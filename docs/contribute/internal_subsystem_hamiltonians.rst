Subsystem Hamiltonians
======================

The Hamiltonian describing a Rydberg gate pulse on a group of atoms is block-diagonal, with one subsystem for every computational basis state.
To determine the dynamics of a gate pulse, one can analyze the dynamics of each subsystem separately.
A transformations to a convenient basis may reduce the dimensionality of a subsystem.
Moreover, infinite Rydberg interaction strengths lead to a reduction of the relevant Hilbert space dimension.

Here, we provide subsystem Hamiltonians for various numbers of atoms in :math:`|1\rangle`, arranged in various geometries, exhibiting interactions of infinite or finite strength when excited to :math:`|r\rangle`.
